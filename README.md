## Numerical Algorithm Repository Description
In this repository, we will state several practically numerical algorithm initially, and show the examples and codes which can you have explicit understanding about the algorithms. Later, we will follow some cutting-edge papers about numerical algorithms, do the code reproduction, and share in this repository.

## Prerequisites

* At least one programming language, Matlab, python, or other languages if you are familiar with.
* Understanding of variables, data types, vector, matrix and basic function usage in your chosen programming language.
* Basic knowledge of Mathematical Analysis and Linear Algebra.

These won't be enforced by the instructor, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts. If you need a refresher, take a look at the beginner material we will upload.

## Topics Overview

We will dive into the basic algorithm, and the nuances of them. Practical tools in Python and Matlab will be discussed, but we do not recommond you use that when you try to comprehend the numerical algorithms.  The focus will be on complexity, convergency, and stability.  Topics covered include:

* 
*
*


Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, available at [https://github.com/Gonewiththewind4/Numerical-Algorithm/tree/master](https://github.com/Gonewiththewind4/Numerical-Algorithm/tree/master).  Additional exercises will completed in wiki.

See [perface](upload later) for  background.

### Workflow

If you're using GitHub Desktop, these general instructions will help:

* <https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/>
* <https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/>

Enabling `Edit`->`Automatically Sync after Committing` is recommended. Here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/Gonewiththewind4/Numerical-Algorithm](https://github.com/Gonewiththewind4/Numerical-Algorithm)).
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository.



### Program Skill Requirements

These apply to real life, as well.

* [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) build should pass if you want to use it. For matlab codes, please try Jenkins for continous integration.
* Must apply "good programming style" learned in class
    * Functions should be "short" (see [Sandi Metz's rules for developers](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)).
    * Optimize for readability.
        * ["Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute." -Harold Abelson](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9168-programs-must-be-written-for-people-to-read-and-only)
    * Avoid using anonymous callbacks within other functions, especially if the callback is more than one or two lines.
    * For projects, use Object-Oriented Programming.
* Any borrowed code must be properly [annotated](#instructor).
